## Testing

To test the chat, you need to enter the following commands:

You need to clone the repository using the command:
 
 `git clone git@github.com:ToxichQQQ/SimpleChat.git`

After the repository has been copied, go to the repository and run the `npm install` command. 

Then go to the server folder and do the same

Start the server using the `node server.js`

Start the client using the `npm start`
